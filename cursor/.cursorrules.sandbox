# .cursorrules — 05-agent-experiments-and-spikes

## Purpose
- This repo (or subfolder) is for experiments and spikes around agentic workflows.
- Goals:
  - Rapid exploration of ideas.
  - Clear separation from production code.
  - Easy promotion path when an experiment matures.

## Folder conventions
- `sandbox/**`:
  - Short-lived experiments, PoCs, and notebooks/scripts.
- `lab/**`:
  - More stable prototypes that might be promoted later.
- `promoted/**`:
  - Experiments that are ready to be ported into production repos.

## Behaviour for experimental code
- You may:
  - Relax some style rules to move faster.
  - Call LLMs directly from nodes for quick prototyping.
- You must:
  - Clearly mark experimental code with comments like:
    - `# EXPERIMENTAL: not for production`
  - Avoid hard-coding secrets or real endpoints. Use:
    - Mock URLs
    - Fake keys
    - Local dockerised services

## Promotion pathway
- When an experiment is promising:
  - Add a short `PROMOTION_NOTES.md` in its folder describing:
    - What the workflow does.
    - How it could be integrated into existing graphs/tools.
    - Risks and unknowns.
  - Suggest where the code should live in the production repo (`src/graphs`, `src/tools`, `src/domain`, etc.).

## Testing expectations
- Even experiments should:
  - Include at least one rough test or script that exercises the main path.
  - Prefer deterministic checks when easy to do.
- Before promoting:
  - Tighten types, remove dead code, and add real tests in a `tests/` folder.

## Cursor-specific guidance
- In `sandbox/**`:
  - Optimise for clarity of ideas, not perfect architecture.
  - Leave clear TODOs for production-grade features (proper error handling, logging, evals).
- In `lab/**`:
  - Move closer to production standards:
    - Pydantic models
    - Clear node naming
    - Basic eval scenarios
