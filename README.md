Hey Baz & Co — I've been using these alot lately to help really tune my agents. They are general but useful. Feel free to add anything you think of. Be super creative about how you use them. They can be used to a direcory level or global I believe.

NOTE: Cursor picks up the rules automatically
Just open the repo in Cursor. The .cursorrules files act as the “operating manual” for how agents should write code, structure graphs, add tests, and handle tools.

You don’t need to do anything special — but the behaviour of Cursor will now follow the architecture we’ve defined.

Opencode: CLi tool that can run in parallel in the background - get it :D 

Anything under sandbox/ can be fast, messy, and exploratory — Cursor knows the difference and won’t enforce strict rules there.

The initial rules are based mostly on agentic workflows. I'm also open to a better naming convention but right now we just have to remove the suffix. It's always .cursorrules

PS. If you aren't already using Warp for your terminal get on it! Built in agents
